## Abstract

Grade retention as a remedial policy is controversial as the benefit of extra instruction time may not outweigh its costs. Previous research has only examined retention for specific grades. Exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in retention generated by a nationwide promotion policy in Chile, I show that the timing of retention is critical to determining its effect on academic performance and access to higher education. Being held back only reduces the probability of future grade retention for young primary students. In addition, for older primary students, there is a reduction in their likelihood of returning to school the following academic year or graduating from high school. High school grade-retained students are the most affected, with a 10-20 percentage point reduction in their likelihood of high school graduation, and many switch to adult education as a response to retention. Interestingly, even though high school students who are held back are just as likely to take the college admission test, they show a positive 0.1 SD increase in Spanish and math performance.'
