title: "Gaming the System: Effects of School Cheating on Personnel Decisions and Student Performance"

excerpt: '## Abstract

In this paper, I study the impact of administrative cheating in schools for financing purposes on two margins: school personnel decisions and student performance. In a context where funds are tied to attendance, I create a cheating index using mismatched attendance reports. I exploit random school inspections as a plausibly exogenous shock to schools' incentives to misreport attendance. I estimate the impact of cheating in both the intensive and extensive margins of teacher supply, finding that more cheating is related to more principals per student and also more hours of principals and classroom teachers per student. Nevertheless, no evidence exists that more teaching resources translate into better student performance. The estimated impact of cheating on fourth-graders’ performance is a firm zero for both math and Spanish standardized exams. This null effect of cheating on performance is robust and consistent across different genders, SES levels, rural types of schools, and financial dependence of the school. The lack of an effect on the performance margin suggests that schools engage in cheating but smooth out their educational expenses so as not to be affected if they get caught and fined, hinting that the additional resources do not necessarily reach students. However, more research is needed to completely clarify the reasons behind this null impact.'

## Abstract

In this paper, I study the impact of administrative cheating in schools for financing purposes on two margins: school personnel decisions and student performance. In a context where funds are tied to attendance, I create a cheating index using mismatched attendance reports. I exploit random school inspections as a plausibly exogenous shock to schools' incentives to misreport attendance. I estimate the impact of cheating in both the intensive and extensive margins of teacher supply, finding that more cheating is related to more principals per student and also more hours of principals and classroom teachers per student. Nevertheless, no evidence exists that more teaching resources translate into better student performance. The estimated impact of cheating on fourth-graders’ performance is a firm zero for both math and Spanish standardized exams. This null effect of cheating on performance is robust and consistent across different genders, SES levels, rural types of schools, and financial dependence of the school. The lack of an effect on the performance margin suggests that schools engage in cheating but smooth out their educational expenses so as not to be affected if they get caught and fined, hinting that the additional resources do not necessarily reach students. However, more research is needed to completely clarify the reasons behind this null impact.
