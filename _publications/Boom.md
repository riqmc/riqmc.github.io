## Abstract

We examine how local economic conditions impact human capital accumulation in Chilean copper-producing zones using high-frequency data on copper prices, school attendance, dropout rates, and academic performance. To measure the exposure to copper price volatility, we created an index by determining the proportion of workers in the area associated with the metal mining industry. We performed a difference-in-differences analysis by comparing students in areas with low and high copper exposure during periods of varying prices. The results indicate that increasing copper prices in more exposed areas decreases yearly attendance rates and reduces performance, particularly among high school students. We also find some evidence of an increase in end-of-year dropout rates. The evidence presented in this paper suggests that massive shocks are not necessary to influence the decisions and learning of students in the short run.'
