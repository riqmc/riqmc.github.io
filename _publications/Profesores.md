excerpt: '## Abstract

Schools are expected to equip students with the skills to climb the socioeconomic ladder. This paper examines the contributions of teachers to this process. We explore the determinants of Chile’s college admission test for the universe of test takers between 2013 and 2021. The analysis exploits unique and rich matched teacher-student data gathered from multiple administrative information sources, allowing us to account for student, school, and teacher characteristics. We implement different cognitive achievement production function decompositions. Our findings show that teachers’ performance on the college admission test and whether they hold a formal educational degree predict their students’ success. When switching the focus to the gaps in college admission test scores by school types (public vs. voucher), we document that controlling for students’ pre-high-school performance and predetermined school characteristics significantly reduces the average advantage of voucher schools. However, productivity differences emerge as drivers of disparities across the distribution of test scores. Teacher-student interactions play an important role.'

## Abstract

Schools are expected to equip students with the skills to climb the socioeconomic ladder. This paper examines the contributions of teachers to this process. We explore the determinants of Chile’s college admission test for the universe of test takers between 2013 and 2021. The analysis exploits unique and rich matched teacher-student data gathered from multiple administrative information sources, allowing us to account for student, school, and teacher characteristics. We implement different cognitive achievement production function decompositions. Our findings show that teachers’ performance on the college admission test and whether they hold a formal educational degree predict their students’ success. When switching the focus to the gaps in college admission test scores by school types (public vs. voucher), we document that controlling for students’ pre-high-school performance and predetermined school characteristics significantly reduces the average advantage of voucher schools. However, productivity differences emerge as drivers of disparities across the distribution of test scores. Teacher-student interactions play an important role.
