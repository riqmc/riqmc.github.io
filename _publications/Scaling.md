Evidence from the Field"

excerpt: '## Abstract

It is widely accepted that large-scale cooperation is crucial for organizational performance but is hard to attain. We study two drivers that harness contingent cooperation: reputation (I cooperate with you if I can tell that you have cooperated with others) and reciprocity (I cooperate with you if you also do so—which may occur as an equilibrium outcome among selfish agents, that is, instrumental reciprocity, or due to a social preference for "friends," that is, intrinsic reciprocity). We study workers volunteering to help colleagues avoid workplace accidents and document that (1) cooperation (in the form of volunteering and helping efforts) reduces accidents; (2) reputational benefits weaken when there are many volunteers, so it does not support large-scale cooperation; (3) modifying the formal structure of interactions among workers (via a pre-registered field experiment), so that reciprocity is boosted, effectively supports large-scale cooperation; (4) the latter result seems to be driven by both intrinsic and instrumental reciprocity. Our results contradict the received wisdom of reputation being a more effective driver of large-scale cooperation than reciprocity.'

## Abstract

It is widely accepted that large-scale cooperation is crucial for organizational performance but is hard to attain. We study two drivers that harness contingent cooperation: reputation (I cooperate with you if I can tell that you have cooperated with others) and reciprocity (I cooperate with you if you also do so—which may occur as an equilibrium outcome among selfish agents, that is, instrumental reciprocity, or due to a social preference for "friends," that is, intrinsic reciprocity). We study workers volunteering to help colleagues avoid workplace accidents and document that (1) cooperation (in the form of volunteering and helping efforts) reduces accidents; (2) reputational benefits weaken when there are many volunteers, so it does not support large-scale cooperation; (3) modifying the formal structure of interactions among workers (via a pre-registered field experiment), so that reciprocity is boosted, effectively supports large-scale cooperation; (4) the latter result seems to be driven by both intrinsic and instrumental reciprocity. Our results contradict the received wisdom of reputation being a more effective driver of large-scale cooperation than reciprocity.
